### Augusto Roncaglia

Augusto was my master advisor in Physics at the University of Buenos Aires. 
We worked together in Quantum Thermodynamics, where we proved results related to the microscopical behaviour of quantum systems in contanct with thermal reservoirs and their thermodynamical limit. 
Quantum is a beutiful theory, and I was luckily to explore it with Augusto.

### Ching-Yao Lai

Yao leads the [Stanford Icy Physics Group](https://icyphysics.stanford.edu/) where I have been a postdoc since September 2024. 
With Yao we are interested in the intersection of machine learning and geophysics.
We are particularly excited about applications in glaciology, differentiable modeling, and inverse problems, and looking forward to how AI can positively impact the physical sciences.

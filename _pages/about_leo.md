### Leonardo Boechi

Leo was my supervisor in [Aristas](https://www.aristas.com.ar/) and, if well he was never my official advisor, he was a mentor during my time at the Univerisity of Buenos Aires. 
Leo taught me about the importance (and joy) of doing science, specially when this is surrounded by people you like. 
He is still today a source of inspiration in my current endeavours.

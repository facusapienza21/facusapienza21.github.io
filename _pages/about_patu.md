### Pablo Groisman 

Patu was my Master co-advisor in Math at the University of Buenos Aires and one of my first instructors during college. 
We spent a lot of time working together in problems related to Euclidean percolation theory to prove consistency results of the Fermat distance. 
With Patu, I not just leant a lot about probability theory, but also the joy of proving results and spending hours discussing math in the whiteboard.

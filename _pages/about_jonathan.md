### Jonathan Taylor

Jonathan is my doctoral co-advisor in Statistics at UC Berkeley. 
We had been working together thinking in application of statisical methods to data-related problems in the cryosphere. 
We are currently working together in sampling methods for probabilistic models that trade-off optimization and sampling strategies.

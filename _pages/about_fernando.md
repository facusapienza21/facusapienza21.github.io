### Fernando PÃ©rez 

Fernando is my primary doctoral advisor in Statistcs at UC Berkeley. 
Since 2019 we had been working together in machine learning methods to model ice flow. 
With Fernando I had learned a lot about software and computing in modern science, emphatazing in core principles of open science, collaboration, and reproducibility.
We also tought and developed together the contents of [STAT159-Collaborative and Reproducible Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-s23.github.io/site/).

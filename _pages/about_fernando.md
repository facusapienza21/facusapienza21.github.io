### Fernando PÃ©rez 

Fernando is my current primary doctoral advisor in Statistcs at UC Berkeley. 
Since 2019 we had been working together in machine learning methods applied to model ice flow. 
With Fernando I had learned quite a lot about software and computing in modern science, emphatazing in core principles of open science, collaboration, and reproducibility.
We also tought and developed together the contents of [STAT159-Collaborative and Reproducible Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-s23.github.io/site/).

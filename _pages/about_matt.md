### Matthieu Jonckheere

Matt was my co-adivor in the Math program in the University of Buenos Aires and also my boss in [Aristas](https://www.aristas.com.ar/), where I worked as a data scientist for more than 3 years. 
Matt was the first person to introduce me to machine learning and mathematical problems related to it, where later we starter working in the Fermat distance. 
We enjoyed thinking about methods and models we could use to solve some of the real-world problems we where facing with some of our clients in Aristas.

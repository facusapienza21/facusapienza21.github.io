### Matthieu Jonckheere

Matt was my co-advisor in the Math program in the University of Buenos Aires and also my supervisor in [Aristas](https://www.aristas.com.ar/), where I worked as a data scientist for more than 3 years. 
Matt was the first person to introduce me to machine learning and mathematical problems related to it, and later we starter working in the Fermat distance. 
We enjoyed working on machine learning methods applied to solve some of the real-world problems we where facing with our clients in Aristas.

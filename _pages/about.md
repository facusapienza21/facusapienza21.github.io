I am an Argentinian PhD candidate working in the intersection of physics-informed machine learning, earth sciences and scientific computing. I am fortunate to be advised by Fernando PÃ©rez (UC Berkeley, Project Jupyter) and Jonathan Taylor (Stanford). 

Large part of my work is motivated by the use of differential equations as regression mechanisms to model complex geophysical systems. By leveraging in modern differential programming tools, it is possible to train machine learning models where the elements of the model are given by the numerical solutions of physical constrained differential equations. This allows to combined both data and physics-driven approaches. I focus in the applications of this tools for mountain glacier modelling, where I work in funcional inversion problems aiming to discover empirical laws governing the flow of ice. With the advent of rich datasets with larger spatial and temporal coverage, it is becoming possible to model glaciers at global scale. 

I also work in data-driven approaches for the modelling of apparent polar wander paths, where the objective in to learn about the past motion of plate tectonics by relying in paleomagnetic data. This involves learning patterns from scarse and noise data supported in the sphere. 

I am enthusiastic about open science and reproducibility research, and the ways that data science can help to democratize science. It is my belief that physics and earth science will benefit from the incorporation of data driven-approaces.

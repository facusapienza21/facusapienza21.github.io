I am a Argentinian PhD candidate working in the intersection of physics-informed machine learning, earth sciences and scientific computing. I am fortunate to be advised by Fernando PÃ©rez (UC Berkeley, Project Jupytere) and Jonathan Tayloy (Stanford). 

I am still working in this website, so hopefully you will soon find more about my research and interests!

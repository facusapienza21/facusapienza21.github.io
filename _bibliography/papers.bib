  abstract = {Abstract The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission has been orbiting Mars since 2014 and now has over 10,000 orbits which we use to characterize Mars' dynamic space environment. Through global field line tracing with MAVEN magnetic field data we find an altitude dependent draping morphology that differs from expectations of induced magnetospheres in the vertical ( Mars Sun-state, MSO) direction. We quantify this difference from the classical picture of induced magnetospheres with a Bayesian multiple linear regression model to predict the draped field as a function of the upstream interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), remanent crustal fields, and a previously underestimated induced effect. From our model we conclude that unexpected twists in high altitude dayside draping (>800 km) are a result of the IMF component in the MSO direction. We propose that this is a natural outcome of current theories of induced magnetospheres but has been underestimated due to approximations of the IMF as solely directed. We additionally estimate that distortions in low altitude (<800 km) dayside draping along are directly related to remanent crustal fields. We show dayside draping traces down tail and previously reported inner magnetotail twists are likely caused by the crustal field of Mars, while the outer tail morphology is governed by an induced response to the IMF direction. We conclude with an updated understanding of induced magnetospheres which details dayside draping for multiple directions of the incoming IMF and discuss the repercussions of this draping for magnetotail morphology.},

  abstract = {Abstract Sampling strategies used in paleomagnetic studies play a crucial role in dictating the accuracy of our estimates of properties of the ancient geomagnetic field. However, there has been little quantitative analysis of optimal paleomagnetic sampling strategies and the community has instead defaulted to traditional practices that vary between laboratories. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of alternative paleomagnetic sampling strategies through numerical experiments and an associated analytical framework. Our findings demonstrate a strong correspondence between the accuracy of an estimated paleopole position and the number of sites or independent readings of the time-varying paleomagnetic field, whereas larger numbers of in-site samples have a dwindling effect. This remains true even when a large proportion of the sample directions are spurious. This approach can be readily achieved in sedimentary sequences by distributing samples stratigraphically, considering each sample as an individual site. However, where the number of potential independent sites is inherently limited the collection of additional in-site samples can improve the accuracy of the paleopole estimate (although with diminishing returns with increasing samples per site). Where an estimate of the magnitude of paleosecular variation is sought, multiple in-site samples should be taken, but the optimal number is dependent on the expected fraction of outliers. The use of filters based on angular distance helps the accuracy of paleopole estimation, but leads to inaccurate estimates of paleosecular variation. We provide both analytical formulas and a series of interactive Jupyter notebooks allowing optimal sampling strategies to be developed from user-informed expectations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Our understanding of Earth's paleogeography relies heavily on paleomagnetic apparent polar wander paths (APWPs), which represent the time-dependent position of Earth's spin axis relative to a given block of lithosphere. However, conventional approaches to APWP construction have significant limitations. First, the paleomagnetic record contains substantial noise that is not integrated into APWPs. Second, parametric assumptions are adopted to represent spatial and temporal uncertainties even where the underlying data do not conform to the assumed distributions. The consequences of these limitations remain largely unknown. Here, we address these challenges with a bottom-up Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation scheme that operates on site-level paleomagnetic data. To demonstrate our methodology, we present an extensive compilation of site-level Cenozoic paleomagnetic data from North America, which we use to generate a high-resolution APWP. Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of substantial noise, polar wandering can be assessed with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution.},

  abstract={Geoscientific models are facing increasing challenges to exploit growing datasets coming from remote sensing. Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), aided by differentiable programming, provide a new scientific modelling paradigm enabling both complex functional inversions to potentially discover new physical laws and data assimilation from heterogeneous and sparse observations. We demonstrate an application of UDEs as a proof of concept to learn the creep component of ice flow, i.e. a nonlinear diffusivity differential equation, of a glacier evolution model. By combining a mechanistic model based on a 2D Shallow Ice Approximation Partial Differential Equation with an embedded neural network, i.e. a UDE, we can learn parts of an equation as nonlinear functions that then can be translated into mathematical expressions. We implemented this modelling framework as ODINN.jl, a package in the Julia programming language, providing high performance, source-to-source automatic differentiation (AD) and seamless integration with tools and global datasets from the Open Global Glacier Model in Python. We demonstrate this concept for 17 different glaciers around the world, for which we successfully recover a prescribed artificial law describing ice creep variability by solving ca 500,000 Ordinary Differential Equations in parallel. Furthermore, we investigate which are the best tools in the scientific machine learning ecosystem in Julia to differentiate and optimize large nonlinear diffusivity UDEs. This study represents a proof of concept for a new modelling framework aiming at discovering empirical laws for large-scale glacier processes, such as the variability of ice creep and basal sliding for ice flow, and new hybrid surface mass balance models.},

  abstract={The Fermat distance has been recently established as a useful tool for machine learning tasks when a natural distance is not directly available to the practitioner or to improve the results given by Euclidean distances by exploding the geometrical and statistical properties of the dataset. This distance depends on a parameter α that greatly impacts the performance of subsequent tasks. Ideally, the value of α should be large enough to navigate the geometric intricacies inherent to the problem. At the same, it should remain restrained enough to sidestep any deleterious ramifications stemming from noise during the process of distance estimation. We study both theoretically and through simulations how to select this parameter.}

  abstract={We introduce heat engines working in the nanoregime that allow one to extract a finite amount of deterministic work. Using the resource theory approach to themodynamics, we show that the efficiency of these cycles is strictly smaller than Carnot's, and we associate this difference with a fundamental irreversibility that is present in single-shot transformations. When fluctuations in the extracted work are allowed there is a trade-off between their size and the efficiency. As the size of fluctuations increases so does the efficiency and optimal efficiency is attained for unbounded fluctuations, while a certain amount of deterministic work is drawn from the cycle. Finally, we show that when the working medium is composed of many particles, by creating an amount of correlations between the subsystems that scale logarithmically with their number, Carnot's efficiency can also be approached in the asymptotic limit along with deterministic work extraction.},

  abstract={Owing to the axial symmetry of the Earth’s magnetic field, paleomagnetic data only directly record the latitudinal and azimuthal positions of crustal blocks in the past, and paleolongitude cannot be constrained. An ability to overcome this obstacle is thus of fundamental importance to paleogeographic reconstruction. Paleomagnetic Euler pole (PEP) analysis presents a unique means to recover such information, but prior implementations of the PEP method have incorporated subjective decisions into its execution, undercutting its fidelity and rigor. Here we present an optimization approach to PEP analysis that addresses some of these deficiencies—namely the objective identification of change-points and small-circle arcs that together approximate an apparent polar wander path. We elaborate on our novel methodology and conduct some experiments with synthetic data to demonstrate its performance. We furthermore present implementations of our methods both as adaptable, stand-alone scripts in Python and as a streamlined interactive workflow that can be operated through a web browser.},

We assume a nonparametric causal graphical model with, possibly, hidden variables and at least one adjustment set comprised of observable variables. We provide the definition of a valid adjustment set for a point exposure dynamic treatment regime, which generalizes the existing definition for a static intervention. We show that there exists an adjustment set, referred to as optimal minimal, that yields the nonparametric estimator of the interventional mean with the smallest asymptotic variance among those that are based on observable minimal adjustment sets. An observable minimal adjustment set is a valid adjustment set such that all its variables are observable and the removal of any of its variables destroys its validity. We provide similar optimality results for the class of observable minimum adjustment sets, that is, valid observable adjustment sets of minimum cardinality among the observable adjustment sets. Moreover, we show that if either no variables are hidden or if all the observable variables are ancestors of either treatment, outcome or the variables that are used to decide treatment, a globally optimal adjustment set exists. We provide polynomial-time algorithms to compute the globally optimal, optimal minimal and optimal minimum adjustment sets. Because static interventions can be viewed as a special case of dynamic regimes, all our results also apply for static interventions.}

They are also relevant in thermodynamic transformations, and their creation is usually associated to some energetic cost. In this work, we study the role of correlations in the thermodynamic process of state formation in the single-shot regime, and find that correlations can also be viewed as a resource. First, we show that the energetic cost of creating multiple copies of a given state can be reduced by allowing correlations in the final state. We obtain the minimum cost for every finite number of subsystems, and then we show that this feature is not restricted to the case of copies. More generally, we demonstrate that in the asymptotic limit, by allowing a logarithmic amount of correlations, we can recover standard results where the free energy quantifies this minimum cost.},

  abstract={A phenomenological model based on a linear relationship between the magnetic coercivity field and the reciprocal of the grain diameter is applied to explain the anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) imparted to artificial samples with different concentrations of a very well characterized magnetite powder. By analyses of scanning electron microscopy images, the spherically shaped single domain synthetic magnetite is found to follow a lognormal grain size distribution with ~86 nm of mean diameter. The proposed model, fitted to ARM measurements up to a peak alternating field of 100 mT, yields a very good agreement. The coercivity behaviour predicted by micromagnetism theory disagrees with the experimental results of this work. A likely explanation for the discrepancy is that the magnetite particles, which consist of a mixture of grains in coherent rotation and curling modes, produce similar observations as domain processes.},

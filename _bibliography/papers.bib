  abstract = {Abstract The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission has been orbiting Mars since 2014 and now has over 10,000 orbits which we use to characterize Mars' dynamic space environment. Through global field line tracing with MAVEN magnetic field data we find an altitude dependent draping morphology that differs from expectations of induced magnetospheres in the vertical ( Mars Sun-state, MSO) direction. We quantify this difference from the classical picture of induced magnetospheres with a Bayesian multiple linear regression model to predict the draped field as a function of the upstream interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), remanent crustal fields, and a previously underestimated induced effect. From our model we conclude that unexpected twists in high altitude dayside draping (>800 km) are a result of the IMF component in the MSO direction. We propose that this is a natural outcome of current theories of induced magnetospheres but has been underestimated due to approximations of the IMF as solely directed. We additionally estimate that distortions in low altitude (<800 km) dayside draping along are directly related to remanent crustal fields. We show dayside draping traces down tail and previously reported inner magnetotail twists are likely caused by the crustal field of Mars, while the outer tail morphology is governed by an induced response to the IMF direction. We conclude with an updated understanding of induced magnetospheres which details dayside draping for multiple directions of the incoming IMF and discuss the repercussions of this draping for magnetotail morphology.},

  abstract = {Abstract Sampling strategies used in paleomagnetic studies play a crucial role in dictating the accuracy of our estimates of properties of the ancient geomagnetic field. However, there has been little quantitative analysis of optimal paleomagnetic sampling strategies and the community has instead defaulted to traditional practices that vary between laboratories. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of alternative paleomagnetic sampling strategies through numerical experiments and an associated analytical framework. Our findings demonstrate a strong correspondence between the accuracy of an estimated paleopole position and the number of sites or independent readings of the time-varying paleomagnetic field, whereas larger numbers of in-site samples have a dwindling effect. This remains true even when a large proportion of the sample directions are spurious. This approach can be readily achieved in sedimentary sequences by distributing samples stratigraphically, considering each sample as an individual site. However, where the number of potential independent sites is inherently limited the collection of additional in-site samples can improve the accuracy of the paleopole estimate (although with diminishing returns with increasing samples per site). Where an estimate of the magnitude of paleosecular variation is sought, multiple in-site samples should be taken, but the optimal number is dependent on the expected fraction of outliers. The use of filters based on angular distance helps the accuracy of paleopole estimation, but leads to inaccurate estimates of paleosecular variation. We provide both analytical formulas and a series of interactive Jupyter notebooks allowing optimal sampling strategies to be developed from user-informed expectations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Our understanding of Earth's paleogeography relies heavily on paleomagnetic apparent polar wander paths (APWPs), which represent the time-dependent position of Earth's spin axis relative to a given block of lithosphere. However, conventional approaches to APWP construction have significant limitations. First, the paleomagnetic record contains substantial noise that is not integrated into APWPs. Second, parametric assumptions are adopted to represent spatial and temporal uncertainties even where the underlying data do not conform to the assumed distributions. The consequences of these limitations remain largely unknown. Here, we address these challenges with a bottom-up Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation scheme that operates on site-level paleomagnetic data. To demonstrate our methodology, we present an extensive compilation of site-level Cenozoic paleomagnetic data from North America, which we use to generate a high-resolution APWP. Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of substantial noise, polar wandering can be assessed with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution.},

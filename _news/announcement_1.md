New preprint available! [Quantitative Analysis of Paleomagnetic Sampling Strategies](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2023JB027211) :bell: 

***

Check on our new preprint about using Universal Differential Equations for modelling glacier flow. Here we explore the use of differential programming capabilities in the Julia programming language to model the differential equations used to explain the flow of mountain glaciers.

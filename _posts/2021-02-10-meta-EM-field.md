The principle of conservation of energy is one of the central pillars in modern physics. 
There are many different forms of exchangeable energy. However, how much metaphysical content does each one of these different notions of energy have? Is it a must to believe in such manifestations of energy in order to describe the behaviour of the world? The usefulness of such concepts is out of question, especially when used as mathematical tools to model physical systems. But at a more fundamental level, do we need to believe in them?  

There are many ways to address this question and contextualize it into more complex discussions in philosophy, such as the debate of realism-antirealism. In this blog post I would like to focus on one of these energetic entities: the electromagnetic field and the photon. 

Most of the objects we see and we experience in our everyday life are described by Classical Electromagnetism (EM), the theory that describes the behaviour of electrically charged particles and electromagnetic waves (light). 
Maxwell's four equations give a full and compact description of the behaviour of the electromagnetic field, described by both the electrical ($E$) and magnetic ($B$) three-dimensional fields, and how these are linked to the distribution and movement of charged particles in space.
From the EM field, we can infer the force that acts in a given charged particle immersed in that field using the Lorentz equation:
$$
F = q (E + v \times B)
$$ 

Once we have the force, we can use Newton's equation to compute the trajectory of charged particles given some initial conditions. 
Then, a standard problem that will rise in an electromagnetism course will be this: computing the EM field that a set of charged particles moving in space generate in order to infer the effect that these will have in the movements of any other particle. 

Even more, Maxwell's equations allow us to compute the evolution in time of $E$ and $B$ given some initial conditions of the field plus boundary conditions (that is, the value of both $E$ and $B$ on a surface that surrounds our physical system; if we are considering an open system without boundaries, we don't need to specify this). 
In the latter case, there is no need to specify the state of the charged particles that generated this EM field in the first place.
